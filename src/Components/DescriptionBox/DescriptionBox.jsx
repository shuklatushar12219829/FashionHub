            An eCommerce website is an online platform that enables businesses and individuals to buy and sell products or services over the internet. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar stores, eCommerce websites provide a virtual storefront where customers can browse, compare, and purchase items from any location with internet access. They typically feature product listings, shopping carts, secure payment options, and customer accounts, allowing users to manage their orders and track deliveries. eCommerce sites cater to various industries, from fashion and electronics to digital products, making shopping more convenient and expanding the reach of businesses beyond physical locations.

            In eCommerce, clothing sizes are standardized from XS to XL or use numeric values (like 4, 6, 8) to suit diverse body types, making online shopping more accessible and tailored. Color options range widely from classic shades like black and white to vibrant hues and unique patterns, offering customers a broad selection that can be easily viewed and compared on eCommerce websites, enhancing the convenience and personalization of online fashion shopping.
